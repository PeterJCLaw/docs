- Support for [custom Arduino commands](/api/servo-assembly/arduino-commands/)
- Implement [Cartesian coordinate system](/api/vision/coordinates/#cartesian-coordinates)
- Fix issue with camera after code terminates
- Remove dates from logs (They were wrong anyway)
- Remove unnecessary noisy log messages
- Remove unnecessary `size` attribute from a marker
- Deprecate broken `polar` coordinate system in favour of [`spherical`](/api/vision/coordinates/#spherical-coordinates)
- Flash the start LED once robot is ready (Also reduced chance of press not being registered)
- Make camera return items when indexing rather than interacting

{{% notice warning %}}
The currently existing polar coordinate system is deprecated in favour of spherical. The spherical system is easier to understand, and better documented than polar. We recommend updating as soon as possible!
