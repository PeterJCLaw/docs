# 2018.02 Changes

Vision:

- Completely redo vision to greatly increase its accuracy (now all Cartesian co-ordinates are within 15% of their distance from the camera, all angles are within 5 degrees.)
- Greatly improve marker detection, it is now much less dependent on lighting conditions.

Logging:

- Add a version number message on start-up.
- Improve robot logging so you know which messages come from our code, and which comes from yours.

Other:

- Add a method to wait for the start button to be pressed, so you can set servos before the start button is pressed.


## Coming soon:

- Orientation of markers (rotation of a marker around its centre.)
