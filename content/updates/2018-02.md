Vision:

- Completely re-do vision to greatly increase accuracy.
- Improve marker detection, it is now much less dependent on lighting conditions.
- Cartesian co-ordinates can now have non-zero `Y` values.

Logging:

- Add a version number message on start-up.
- Improve robot logging so you know which messages are from our code, and which are from yours.

Other:

- Add a method to wait for the start button to be pressed, so you can set servos before the start button is pressed.
