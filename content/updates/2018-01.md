- Remove unnecessary noisy log messages
- Remove unnecessary `size` attribute from a marker
- Deprecate broken `polar` coordinate system in favour of [`spherical`](/api/vision/coordinates/#spherical-coordinates)

- Reduced chance of pressing the start button not being registered
- Make indexing into a list of markers actually return a marker instance, instead of `None`

{{% notice warning %}}
The currently existing polar coordinate system is deprecated in favour of spherical. The spherical system is easier to understand, and better documented than polar. We recommend updating as soon as possible!
