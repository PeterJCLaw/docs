title: Updates
---

Keeping your kit up to date is very important. It enables us to deploy new features, as well as fix bugs.

The following table outlines the updates which have been published, each of
which is available in two formats:

* an [update file](/kit/pi/update-file)
* a [full image](/kit/pi/sd-card)

The update files are the easiest way to apply an update and are the recommended
approach. The full images are provided in case an update goes wrong or you need
to completely wipe your Pi for some reason.

Once you have downloaded the file you need, refer to the documentation on
[updating your pi](/kit/pi/#updating-your-pi) to apply the update.

Each update file is a complete upgrade. Each file contains the changes of those before it. If you need to jump up multiple versions, you can do so by using the latest file.

{{% notice warning %}}
Downgrading using the update file is not supported, and may lead to odd behaviour. If for whatever reason you need to downgrade, flash the SD card.
