[Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) use three perpendicular axes (typically _x_, _y_ and _z_) to specify a point in space.

## Cartesian Coordinates
The Cartesian position is represented as 3 coordinates, `x`, `y` and `z`. These coordinates are relative to the view of the webcam.

- `x` - the x coordinate, positive in the right direction.
- `y` - the y coordinate, positive in the up direction.
- `z` - the z coordinate, the distance forwards in front of the camera.

For example, if `x`, `y` and `z` were `0`, `0` and `1` respectively, the marker would be one metre directly in front of the camera.
