title: Included Libraries
---

Python already comes with plenty of [built-in libraries](https://docs.python.org/{{% python_version %}}/py-modindex.html) to use. We install some extra ones which may be of use:

- [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)
- [scipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy)
