# SourceBots Robotics Documentation


This is the documentation showing how to use the kit and the robots Python API.

There are a number of sections in the documentation, offering help for the IDE, the kit and programming. Under the tutorials section, a number of these things are combined to help you understand what you can, or need, to do.

Within this documentation, you will come across a number of boxes like this:

```python
# code example
```

These are code examples provided to help you.

From time to time, you may come across some warnings such as the following:

{{% notice warning %}}
Charge Your Batteries!
{{% /notice %}}

It would be advisable to take note of these, especially that one! You will also come across some blue boxes providing information, similar to the following:

{{% notice note %}}
Some useful information... like the information given in the information box above.
{{% /notice %}}
