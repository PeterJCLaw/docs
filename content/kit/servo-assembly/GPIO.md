The arduino allows you to connect your kit to your own electronics. It has 14 digital I/O pins, and 4 analogue. The analogue pins can read an analogue signal from 0 to 5V. The board also has a couple of ground pins, as well as some pins fixed at 3.3V and 5V output.

The pin layout of the servo assembly is the same as an Arduino uno.

The servo hat communicates using 2 of the analogue input pins (4 and 5), and so these are inaccessible.
