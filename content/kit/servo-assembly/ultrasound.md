title: Ultrasound

Ultrasound sensors are connected to 2 pins, a _trigger_ pin, and an _echo_ pin. A signal is sent to the sensor on the _trigger_ pin, and the delay on a response on the _echo_ pin can be used to calculate the distance.

{{% notice warning %}}
Ultrasound should only be considered accurate up to around 2 metres, beyond that the signal can become distorted and produce erroneous results.
