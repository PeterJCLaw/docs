title: Battery Charging
---

The charging cable is cable-tied to the charger and you must not remove this cable. The charging lead is terminated with 4mm bullet connectors, which present a very high risk of shorting the battery if removed from the charger.

## Charging Checklist
This list must be followed carefully each time a battery is connected to the charger.

1. Plug in the mains adapter and plug it into the battery charger.
2. Connect the charging lead from the charger to the battery. Ensure you plug the lead into the charger first and the battery second to avoid risk of shorting the battery.
3. Connect the monitoring lead from the battery to the charger.
4. Place the battery in the charging bag.
5. Configure the charger using the menu system as follows. 

### Starting Charging

1. If it does not, repeatedly press `Batt.Type/Stop` until it does.
2. Press `Start/Enter` to select lithium battery charging.
3. Press `Start/Enter` to edit the charging current.
4. The current (bottom left) should start blinking. Use the `Inc./Dec.` buttons until it reads 2.2A. Press `Start/Enter` to store the value and to begin editing the battery voltage. Use the `Inc./Dec.` buttons until it reads 11.1V(3S).
5. Hold `Start/Enter` for 3 seconds to confirm. The charger will try to detect the battery.
6. Once the battery has been detected, the screen will show _CONFIRM (ENTER)_. Press `Start/Enter` to start charging.

The important thing to note here is that the number of cells detected by the charger (_R_) and the number of cells set by you (_S_) are both 3. *If either of these numbers are different immediately power down the charger and contact us.*

The screen shows the charging current, the current voltage, the time elapsed and the energy provided to the battery.

### Stopping Charging
The charger will beep when the battery is fully charged. You must then:

1. Press `Stop` button. The beeping should now stop.
2. Unplug the charger from the mains.
3. Unplug the battery from the charging lead, do not unplug the charging lead from the charger with the battery still connected.
4. Unplug the monitoring lead from the battery to the charger.

This process is also the same if you want to stop charging part-way through.
