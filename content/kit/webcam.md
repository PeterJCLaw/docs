To see the outside world, a webcam is used to capture images for them to be processed. The webcam in the kit is a [TeckNet C016](http://www.tecknet.co.uk/c016.html).

## Focus
The webcam has a manual focus ring around the lens. During standard operation, this lens may be knocked, and move the image out of focus, which can seriously reduce the accuracy of the [vision](/api/vision/).

It's recommended to manually focus the camera using a separate computer, and then use a __non permanent__ method (a small drop of hot glue is great for this) to prevent it moving.

## Mounting the camera
The camera can be mounted in many different ways, from cable ties to duct tape. We recommend using the 1/4" screw mount on the base of the camera, commonly used for tripods.

## The LEDs
The front of the webcam has 6 LEDs. The LEDs are controlled only using the dial inline on the USB cable. Although it's a dial, the LEDs only have an _on_ and _off_ state, no granular control.
