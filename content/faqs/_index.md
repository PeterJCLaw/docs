Teams often ask us questions, so we've put the most common ones below, so others can learn from them.

{{% expand "Sometimes a board stops responding, with no error in the logs. Is this normal?" %}}
No. This issue is likely related to the USB hubs. If you connect the boards directly to the Raspberry Pi rather than through a hub, the issue should resolve.

{{% expand "Can we make our robot shoot/destroy/launch projectiles at/ram/jam the sensors of/etc... other robots?" %}}
No. The rules clearly state this is a non-contact sport and any team's robot which deliberately harms another robot will be asked to modify their design. Competitors are also expected to behave within the spirit of good sportsmanship at all times.
