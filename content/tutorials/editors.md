To edit your code, you'll need an editor.

To write code for the kit, you don't need anything specific in your editor, you just need to be able to edit Python (`.py`) text files, and get them onto a USB drive.

Any editor will do, so it's recommended to use one you're already familiar with. If you don't already have a preference, here's some great ones, available on Windows, macOS, and Linux!

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [PyCharm](https://jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime Text 3](https://sublimetext.com) (License recommended for continued use)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows only)
- [IDLE](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IDLE) (Pre-installed with Python on Windows!)
