To test out your robot code, you can use our Simulator. This gives you a realistic environment to run your code, against a dummy robot, without the need for a physical arena. This simulator is currently only available on Windows.

## Installation

1. [Download the Simulator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16cGGOMruRT4f_5V_DPKOLaJuP82h7NGP/view?usp=sharing), and extract it into a directory.
2. Edit the existing `test.py`.
3. Run `run.bat`. This will launch 2 windows: The simulator itself, and a terminal which will hold the output of your application.
